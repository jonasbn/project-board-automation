# Team process

In order to use this the team will need to follow this process. The intention is that this is as process-light as it can be for the development team when devloping complex software products.

### Planning with Issues

### Tasks (PRs) with no issues

### Use the review process in GitHub

### Pick a card from todo and add your name(s) to it

1. Pick a card from todo
2. Add your name(s) to it (pairing is cool)
3. Work on your PR (draft, reviews, changes, merge)
4. Board is updated automatically
5. MOve to `Done` after we deploy (dont let this column get too big)
